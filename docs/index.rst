We try to keep taggo as standalone as possible, so cloning the git

The file called taggo is the main program which you should run.


FAQ
---

* Why the name taggo?

  * I just wanted a name for this for now.. Got any better names,
    please share

* Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?

  * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.
  * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?
  * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.
  * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage
    your files/photos.
